# Tear down a finished task: return the treehouse worktree, release the Orca
# worktree, or retire a secondmate home; kill the recorded runtime endpoint,
# clear volatile state, refresh/prune the project's clone for PR-based ship
# tasks, then print a backlog-refresh reminder for ship and scout teardowns
# (a secondmate teardown prints none, since secondmates are not backlog items).
# REFUSES if the worktree holds work that has not LANDED, because cleanup
# hard-resets/removes the worktree and kills its processes. The landed-work oracle
# is a dirty gate followed by three allow-conditions (ANY one lands it), in order:
#   (a) a dirty worktree (uncommitted changes) is never landed -> always REFUSE,
#       because the reset would discard those changes;
#   then ALLOW when ANY of the following holds, else REFUSE:
#   (b) a recorded landed=<sha> in state/<id>.meta that COVERS HEAD (HEAD is an
#       ancestor of the recorded sha). This is the authoritative verdict written at
#       merge time by bin/fm-pr-merge.sh and bin/fm-merge-local.sh, so teardown does
#       not re-derive it. It makes teardown robust to a no-mistakes run that advanced
#       origin past the local worktree HEAD (local HEAD is an ancestor of the recorded
#       merged head, so the verdict still covers it). Covering HEAD is required: the
#       verdict is about the merged commits, not the task, so commits made AFTER the
#       merge (late review feedback, a follow-up steer, the captain typing into the
#       pane) are not landed, and a landed= that no longer covers HEAD - or the
#       unresolvable pr-<n> placeholder - falls through to (c)/(d) instead of allowing.
#   (c) HEAD is reachable from a publishing remote-tracking branch (a fork counts, so
#       upstream-contribution PRs pushed to a fork satisfy this in any mode). This is
#       the base "landed" definition of prime directive #3 - the work is already
#       published - checked as a cheap, local direct reachability scan, NOT a return
#       of the old PR-head-ancestor or patch-id heuristics. The local no-mistakes gate
#       remote (refs/remotes/no-mistakes/*) is excluded, so a branch pushed there
#       during a failed validation run does not count as landed.
#   (d) with no covering landed= and no publishing remote reachable, the single
#       content fallback: is the branch's content already present in the up-to-date
#       default branch? After any merge (squash, rebase, ff, or a local-only fast-
#       forward) the change is in the default branch regardless of whether the branch's
#       own commits survived. content_in_default fetches the default branch fresh
#       (time-bounded by FM_TEARDOWN_NET_TIMEOUT, default 30s) and refuses when
#       inconclusive - older git without `merge-tree --write-tree`, a timed-out fetch,
#       or a merge conflict - so genuinely unlanded work still REFUSES.
# The evaluation order is deliberate: (b) and (c) are cheap and local, and only (d)
# fetches, so the network is reached only when actually needed. Uncommitted changes
# are never landed. local-only additionally accepts work merged into the local default
# branch (firstmate performs that fast-forward after approval, recording landed=); the
# (d) content check also recognizes a purely local default branch (refs/heads/<default>)
# when there is no remote at all.
# Scout tasks (kind=scout in meta) carve out of that check: their worktree is
# declared scratch and the report at data/<task-id>/report.md is the work
# product. Teardown proceeds only once the report exists and the shared
# unresolved-decision completion gate verifies its captain-held inventory.
# Before destructive cleanup, teardown validates task check artifacts and any
# matching quarantine entries as ordinary single-link files on the state
# device. It refuses and preserves task state when that proof fails; otherwise
# it removes the task's check, trust record, PR sidecar, publication record, and
# quarantine entries with the rest of the volatile state.
# Orca tasks use the same safety checks, then close the recorded terminal and
# remove the recorded worktree through `orca worktree rm`; teardown never guesses
# an Orca target from ambient CLI state.
# A Herdr presentation journal never authorizes cleanup. Teardown still closes
# only the exact task pane from ordinary endpoint metadata and never calls
# `workspace close`. It retires the non-authoritative journal only when a
# read-only token correlation agrees with that endpoint and pane closure is
# confirmed. Otherwise the journal stays quarantined for manual inspection.
# Projected closes share the presentation-order lock, refuse to close the
# captain's active tab, and restore the exact response-derived pre-close tab
# if Herdr's last-pane cleanup focuses an unrelated neighboring workspace.
# Secondmates (kind=secondmate in meta) are retired explicitly. Normal
# teardown refuses while their home has in-flight crewmate meta files; --force
# is the approved discard path that prevalidates child removal targets, discards
# child work, kills child runtime endpoints, and removes the retired home. Removing a
# leased home releases its durable treehouse lease so the pool slot is freed,
# never left leased forever. If the treehouse return fails, teardown leaves the
# leased home and state in place instead of hiding a still-held lease.
# Usage: fm-teardown.sh <task-id> [--force]
#   --force skips ordinary-task dirty and landed-work checks, skips scout report
#   checks, and discards secondmate child work for kind=secondmate. Only use it
#   when the captain has explicitly said to discard the work.
#
# Transient / stale worktree git lock recovery (teardown-lock-race): a crew process
# killed mid-git-operation can leave a .git/worktrees/<wt>/index.lock (or, for a
# non-linked worktree, .git/index.lock) that makes `treehouse return --force` fail
# with Unable to create '...index.lock': File exists. That lock is usually transient
# (the dying process finishes or exits within seconds) and must never be force-deleted
# while a live git process might still own it - the fix is patience, not rm.
#
# On that failure signature only, teardown_treehouse_return:
#   1. Retries up to FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRIES times (default 3), waiting
#      FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS (default 1s; falls back to the older
#      FM_STALE_WORKTREE_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS name when the new one is unset) between
#      attempts. Retries key off the error text, not whether the lock file still
#      exists after the failed attempt - a lock that self-clears mid-check still
#      deserves a retry of the return.
#   2. Other treehouse return failures still abort immediately and loudly (no retry).
#   3. If every retry still hits the lock signature and the lock remains, it is removed
#      and the return tried once more ONLY when the lock is provably stale per
#      bin/fm-lock-lib.sh's fm_lock_is_provably_stale, passing the worktree dir as the
#      companion directory and FM_STALE_WORKTREE_LOCK_AGE_SECS (default 30s) as the age
#      threshold. That shared proof owns the exact lsof-holder, mtime-age, and fail-safe
#      rules.
#   4. If retries exhaust and the lock is not provably stale, teardown fails as loudly
#      as a normal return failure and notes that the lock persisted across the retry
#      window. A missing `lsof`, or a lock that fails any stale check, is treated as
#      NOT provably stale (fail safe): the lock is left untouched.
# The same proof is used when non-force safety inspection cannot run because the lock
# is present; teardown clears only a provably stale lock, then re-runs the safety
# checks before any destructive return. Teardown output notes every wait, retry, and
# removal so the operator can see what happened.
